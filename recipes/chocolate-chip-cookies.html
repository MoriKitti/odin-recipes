    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <em>best</em> chocolate chip cookies you have ever had and as simple and quick as you want them to be. I will warn you for the absolute best flavor you need to make the dough the day before you want to eat them but if you cannot wait that long they can be baked the same day. Letting the dough chill for 30 mins before baking is <strong>not</strong> optional though. If you live in a warmer climate may want to chill for closer to 45mins and make sure to put back in the fridge between scooping batches. This is a great cookie for your trusty cookie scoop. If you want to buy the ones I use myself for cookies and many other projects while also supporting the blog at no cost to your self you can find them here on Amazon. I don't know who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies but if such a person exists this one might convert them. If you use anything other than butter in this recipes then you are making your own unsupported variation and I wish you the best luck because I have no idea how it will turn out. If you wish to learn more about why I do not generally sub out butter for anything else and the few instances I do check out this post here.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>White Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt <em>Double if using unsalted butter</em></li>
        <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream butter by hand or in mixer</li>
        <li>Add sugars and continue to cream until well combined</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time stirring after every addition</li>
        <li>Stir in vanilla</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl or flour sifter combine flour, baking soda and salt and then add dry to wet</li>
        <li>Stir until all flour has been incorporated and has formed an even dough.</li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips until mixed through the whole dough</li>
        <li>Refridgerate dough for 30 mins <em>45 mins for warmer climates</em></li>
        <li>In the meantime prepare your baking sheets. I personally use parchment paper but many prefer silicone baking mats or nothing at all depending on the baking sheet</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon scoop dough onto sheet leaving room for cookies to spread a bit <em>the cooler your dough the less the cookies will spread and thus is you prefer thicker cookies let dough chill for closer than an hour and work fat to scoop and get into the oven but if you prefer more spread cookies 30 min chill time is more than enough</em></li>
        <li>Bake for 11 mins or until edges are golden brown <em>bake times can vary by ovens and how you like your cookies so keep a close eye on them from the 8 min mark and beyond and adjust accordingly to your taste</em></li>
        <li>Place tray on a cooling rack for a few minutes before placing the cookies themselves on the cooling rack to fully cool</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining dough</li>
    </ol>
